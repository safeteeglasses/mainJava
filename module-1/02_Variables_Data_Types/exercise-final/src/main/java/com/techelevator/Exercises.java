        INSTRUCTIONS

        The primary purposes of these exercises are to practice: 
        		
        		1. declaring variables and using assignment statements
        		2. using variables, literals, and operators within arithmetic expressions
        		3. choosing meaningful variable names
        		4. choosing appropriate data types

        One of the hardest things about programming is choosing good names. Spend time
        to find good, meaningful, and descriptive names for your variables. Clarity and
        expressiveness is more important than brevity. Err on the side of longer, more 
        descriptive names over short, cryptic ones.

        Be consistent with your choice of data types, especially when it comes to 
        some values like money. There are many different ways to express money. Pick one, 
        and stick with it throughout these exercises.
        
        Keep your code consistent and well formatted. When code is poorly indented, 
        or lost in a flood of blank lines, it can make it difficult to read.
