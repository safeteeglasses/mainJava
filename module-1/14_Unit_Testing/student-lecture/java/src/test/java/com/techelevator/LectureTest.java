 * convention is that the test class will belong to the same package as the 
 * class under test and the name of the test class is the name of the 
 * production class with "Test" at the end.  For example, the test class

	 * deviates from standard Java method naming conventions by using underscores
	 * between words instead of camelCase. This is my own personal convention and

	 * 
	 * Regardless of whether you use camelCase or underscores, your method names 
	 * should be very descriptive to the point of being overly verbose. This is fine
	 * because you will never write code to invoke your test methods, they are only 
	 * invoked by the Junit framework, hence descriptive trumps concise.
