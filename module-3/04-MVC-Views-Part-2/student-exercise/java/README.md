# Products

# Day 1

A controller has already been created called Products. Your job is to develop a number of different views for a List of Products.

1. [List View](etc/day1/list-view.png)
2. [Tile View](etc/day1/tile-view.png)
3. [Table View](etc/day1/table-view.png)

Model classes representing a `Product` have been provided for you. **Do not modify or simplify the model's properties** for this exercise.

The images have been provided in the `webapp/img` folder.

## Day 2

Convert your existing pages to use a shared layout view so that you are not repeating each site template with each page.

Make the list, tile, and table view have clickable links that redirect the user to the product specific detail view. Suggestions include making the image clickable, the product name clickable, etc.

Implement the [Detail View](etc/day2/product-detail-individual.png) for the individual product.
