All exercises will be using the dvdstore database. DAOs are already created, except for the Customer Search, where you will fill in the data access methods.

## Customer Search

Take a name search and a sort order, display all customers whose `first_name` or `last_name` match the search, in the order specified. The sort order could be by `last_name`, `email`, or `active`. DALs will need to be made for this exercise.
